**Start Date:** January 1, 2026
**Identity:** The Professor / The Builder
**Mission:** Academic Comeback + Internship Ready + Athletic Physique

---

## 🏆 THE 8 RESOLUTIONS (THE CONTRACT)

### 1. The Academic Redemption
* **Goal:** CGPA 8.5+ (Semester 4 & 5).
* **Strategy:** "The Professor Method." If I can't explain it simply on paper, I don't know it.
* **Action:** 1 Hour of focused study daily (separate from coding).

### 2. The Functional Physique
* **Goal:** Athletic "Sleeper Build." High stamina, clean pushups.
* **Routine:** Progressive Calisthenics (Pushups, Squats, Planks).
* **Schedule:** Daily at 05:20 AM.

### 3. Career Focus (Now or Never)
* **Goal:** Shift identity from "Student" to "Junior Engineer."
* **Strategy:** Specialization in C++ & Python.
* **Action:** Treat code like a job. Professional variable names, comments, and commits.

### 4. The Content Pivot (Build in Public)
* **Goal:** Document the journey. Real > Perfect.
* **Strategy:** "The Raw Devlog." No face cam needed, no heavy editing.
* **Platform:** YouTube (Weekly), X/Twitter (Daily Log).

### 5. Radical Consistency
* **Goal:** No Zero Days.
* **Strategy:** "The Seinfeld Strategy." Don't break the chain.
* **Bad Day Protocol:** If sick/tired, do 5 minutes (1 line of code, 5 pushups).

### 6. The War Chest (Internships & DSA)
* **Goal:** Interview-ready by August 2026.
* **Strategy:** GfG 160 / LeetCode Patterns.
* **Action:** 1 Problem per day. Memorize patterns, not just solutions.

### 7. Mental Fortitude (Never Back Down)
* **Goal:** Emotional control.
* **Strategy:** "Debug Mode." When things fail, don't spiral—analyze and fix.

### 8. The Side Hustle
* **Goal:** Earn the first $1 online.
* **Strategy:** Monetized Learning (YouTube Ads/Sponsorships + Selling Notes).
